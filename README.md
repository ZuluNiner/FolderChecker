# Folder Comparer
A basic console application that compares the first level of files and directories between two directories.

## Install
Make sure to download the most recent release on our ["Releases"](https://github.com/ZuluNiner/FolderComparer/releases) page

## Usage
This application asks for two folders, after verifying the folders exist it begins checking the first level directory structure for all files and directories before comparing the two folders and creating a results.txt file with any discrepencies.

_Results are saved in the directory the console application is ran from_

### Coming Soon
- Advnaced Folder Comparer: This will be a full form application rather than a console application that will have more abilities for scanning further into sub-directories and outputting the results in a structured way
